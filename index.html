            <h1>Building Functional Ceramic Pots</h1>
            <p>Building functional ceramics is one of the oldest known human traditions, dating all the way back to 18,000 BC. This process involves forming a clay body into the required shape and then heating the object to high temperatures in a kiln to remove all the water from the object so that it can maintain a hardened state.</p>

    <h2>Building Methods</h2>
            Different methods are used to build functional objects (or, "pots"). Some of those methods include:

    <ul>
        <li>Hand-Building</li>
        <li>Potter's Wheel</li>
        <li>Slab-Rolling</li>
        <li>Slip-casting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clay Bodies</h2>
    <p>Different types of clay bodies are utilized for variance in texture, color, and hardness.</p>
        <img class="clay-photos" width=400 src="img/ball-clay.jpg"/>
        <p>Ball Clay is made up of kaolinite, mica, and quartz. It is a fine-grained sedimentary clay that is described as very plastic in nature.  After firing it is milky white in color.</p>

        <p> Porcelain Clay is made up of only Kaolinite.  It is regarded as the most presitgious type of clay because of its delicacy, strength, and white color.</p>

    <p> Stoneware Clay is made from fine-grained plastic clay bodies of Kaolinite, Mica, and Quartz and varies widely in its elasticity.  These clay bodies often contain impurities like carbon and iron which give the clay a dirty or gritty look.</p>

    <h2>Pottery Decoration</h2>
        <p>The most common form of pottery decoration is glazing.  Glaze is a glassy coating on top of the clay body which functions are decoration as well as protection.</p></section>
